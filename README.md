# Hypertrace Documentation

This site was generated by [www.stackbit.com](https://www.stackbit.com), v0.2.99 and is deployed on [Netlify](https://netlify.com). The site is published automatically by Netlify whenever changes are merged to the main branch.

## Contribute
To contribute, fork the project and submit a pull request! You can look at our contributing guidelines [here](https://github.com/hypertrace/hypertrace/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

If you want to submit prospective content but contributing to public documentation takes too much time/planning, submit your idea or draft to the [Prospective Docs](./prospective-docs) folder and we'll figure it out from there.

Digging into the repo structure a little: 

### Structure

This is a mirrored copy of the documentation available on the [Hypertrace docs website](https://docs.hypertrace.org).

The [src/pages](/src/pages/) folder structure matches the URL structure for the website.

**For example:**  Say you want to edit the deployment article for deploying hypertrace on docker for desktop.  
docs.hypertrace.org location: [https://docs.hypertrace.org/deployments/docker/](https://docs.hypertrace.org/deployments/docker/)  
doc location:  
`src/pages/deployments/docker.md`
  
If you add a screen shot or picture, put it in the media folder closest to the article you're contributing to.

### Easy way to contribute
- All the pages on [docs.hypertrace.org](http://docs.hypertrace.org) have edit button so you can simply click on edit button on page and it will open source file for that page. 
- You can make necessary changes and raise PR.
- Once PR is approved and merged your changes will be live on website.
