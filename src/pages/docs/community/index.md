Hypertrace was originally developed by Traceable as a highly scalable distributed tracing platform. It collects rich, granular production application usage data and trains machine learning algorithms for Traceable’s cloud-native application security platform. 
‍
Realizing that Hypertrace was a powerful standalone tracing and observability platform, Traceable created this open source project for the software development community to use in their applications.

## GitHub

Being a open-source product, our source code is available under hypertrace organization on [GitHub](https://github.com/hypertrace). We welcome contributions from everyone to make Hypertrace a best open-source tracing platform out there.
