Hypertrace is a highly scalable distributed tracing and observability platform designed to ingest and analyze large volumes of production trace data. OpenTelemetry-based agents collect and send observability data directly from applications to Hypertrace for analysis. Data visualizations, reports, and dashboards are available in a web-based console to assist in monitoring cloud-native applications and resolving application and service performance problems.
