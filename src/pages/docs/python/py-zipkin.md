### Introduction
Zipkin is a distributed tracing system. It helps gather timing data needed to troubleshoot latency problems in microservice architectures.

It manages both the collection and lookup of this data. Zipkinâ€™s design is based on the Google Dapper paper.

OpenCensus Python has support for this exporter available through package [opencensus.trace.exporters.zipkin_exporter](https://census-instrumentation.github.io/opencensus-python/trace/api/zipkin_exporter.html)


### Creating the exporter
To create the exporter, we'll need to:

* Create an exporter in code
* Have the Zipkin endpoint available to receive traces
 
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

from opencensus.ext.zipkin.trace_exporter import ZipkinExporter
from opencensus.trace.tracer import Tracer

def main():
    ze = ZipkinExporter(
        service_name="service-a",
        host_name="localhost",
        port=9411,
        endpoint="/api/v2/spans")

    tracer = Tracer(exporter=ze)
    with tracer.span(name="doingWork") as span:
        for i in range(10):
            pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
 

### Viewing your traces
Please visit the Hypertrace UI endpoint [http://localhost](http://localhost).
