## Quick start with Hypertrace

The best part is that if you are already using a tracing system, you can start today. Hypertrace accepts all major data formats: Jaeger, OpenTracing, Zipkin, you name it. Even if you arenâ€™t tracing yet, we have a bunch of sample apps you can start with, and a chat room of excited people who want to meet you. Here we will tell you how you can get started with Online Boutique sample app which is one of our trace enabled sample applications.

### Sample app: Online Boutique (created by Google Cloud)

Online Boutique is a cloud-native microservices demo app consisting of 10 microservices. Microservices are written in Go, c#, Python, Java and functions as an e-commerce website app where users can browse items, add them to a shopping cart, and checkout.

This demo has services such as Product catalog, Recommendation, Shopping Cart, Checkout page, Payment, Shipping and more. It isn't built to operate as a real world ecommerce platform which can have so many reasons to fail but this makes a good, familiar use case for demo purposes.

#### Deployment instructions

Use pre-built public container images that are easy to deploy by deploying the [release manifest](./release) directly to an existing K8s cluster.

**Prerequisite**: A running Kubernetes cluster (local or cloud).

1. Clone this repository, and go to the repository directory
2. Run `kubectl apply -f ./release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml` to deploy the sample app.
3. Run `kubectl get pods` to confirm pods are in a Ready state.
4. Find the `NodePort` of your application, then visit the application at `localhost:nodeport` in your
   browser to confirm installation. 

   ```sh
   kubectl get service/frontend-external
   ```

#### This is how your application will look like!
