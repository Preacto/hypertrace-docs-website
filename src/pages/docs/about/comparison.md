## Comparison: Hypertrace vs. Other open-source tracing solutions
| Other open soure products           | Hypertrace                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| High Scalability                    | Flow map at scale. Jaeger only supports the flowmap with all-in-one setup, which isnâ€™t production scale. For production, one needs to run separate Spark jobs to generate the dependency graph. |
| Native support for OpenTracing      | APIs detected automatically. Flowmaps and metrics for APIs.                                                                                                                                     |
| Multiple storage backends           | Metrics and flowmaps for Services                                                                                                                                                               |

| Backwards compatibility with Zipkin | Flexible query interface to build your own UIs                                                                                                                                                  |
|                                     | OLAP store is pluggable with abstractions (need to add request handlers in QueryService)                                                                                                        |
