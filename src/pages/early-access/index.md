Weâ€™re excited to have you join us for Hypertrace early access. The next step is to check your email for an invitation to join us on Slack where you will download the Hypertrace installation script and Helm chart. You can also visit the '<a href="https://docs.hypertrace.org/getting-started/">Getting Started</a>' section of the Hypertrace Docs for further instructions.

We hope you get as excited about Hypertrace as we are. Whether you have questions or not, let us know what you think in Slack. 

See you soon!
