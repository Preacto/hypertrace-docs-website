Hypertrace was originally developed by Traceable as a highly scalable distributed tracing platform. It collects rich, granular production application usage data and trains machine learning algorithms for Traceable’s cloud-native application security platform. 
‍
Realizing that Hypertrace was a powerful standalone tracing and observability platform, Traceable created this open source project for the software development community to use in their applications.

## GitHub

Being a open-source product, our source code is available under Hypertrace organization on [GitHub](https://github.com/hypertrace). We welcome contributions from everyone to make Hypertrace a best open-source tracing platform out there. 


## Slack
The best part is that if you are already using a tracing system, you can start today. Hypertrace accepts all major data formats: Jaeger, OpenTracing, Zipkin, you name it. Even if you aren’t tracing yet, we have a bunch of sample apps you can start with, and a chat room of excited people who want to meet you. Join us today on [slack](https://hypertrace.slack.com).
