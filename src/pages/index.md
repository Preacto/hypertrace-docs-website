    title: Quickstart with online boutique sample
    content: >-
      Online Boutique is a cloud-native microservices demo application. Online
      Boutique consists of a 10-tier microservices application. Online boutique
      uses different microservices written in Go, c#, Python, Java and functions
      as an e-commerce website app, where users can browse items, add them to
      the cart, and purchase them.


      This demo has various ecommerce microservices like order page, cart,
      payment, shipping, recommendation though it doesn't operate under the
      scale as real world ecommerce platform which can have so many reasons to
      fail but this makes really good close to real-world case for our testing.
